She also figures that Crawford chose her\, as a woman\, to be able to trigger some emotional response from Lecter. After speaking to Lecter for the first time\, she realizes that everything with him will be a psychological game\, with her often having to read between the very cryptic lines he provides. She has to decide how much she will play along\, as his request in return for talking to him is to expose herself emotionally to him. The case takes a more dire turn when a sixth victim is discovered\, this one from who they are able to retrieve a key piece of evidence\, if Lecter is being forthright as to its meaning. A potential seventh victim is high profile Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith)\, the daughter of Senator Ruth Martin (Diane Baker)\, which places greater scrutiny on the case as they search for a hopefully still alive Catherine. Who may factor into what happens is Dr. Frederick Chilton (Anthony Heald)\, the warden at the prison\, an opportunist who sees the higher profile with Catherine\, meaning a higher profile for himself if he can insert himself successfully into the proceedings.','Jonathan Demme','Thomas Harris\, Ted Tally','Jodie Foster\, Anthony Hopkins\, Lawrence A.

Things change for Lester when he falls in love at first sight with Jane''s more experienced classmate\, Angela Hayes. Both Janie and Angela can see Lester''s sexual infatuation with Angela\, who courts such attention from any man as a sign that she is model material\, she having once appeared in Seventeen and is a career to which she aspires. Lester''s infatuation with Angela gives him a reenergized view on life\, where he openly doesn''t care anymore what anyone thinks about what he does\, anyone except Angela.

Gandhi realizes that the laws are biased against Indians and decides to start a non-violent protest campaign for the rights of all Indians in South Africa. After numerous arrests and the unwanted attention of the world\, the government finally relents by recognizing rights for Indians\, though not for the native blacks of South Africa. After this victory\, Gandhi is invited back to India\, where he is now considered something of a national hero. He is urged to take up the fight for India''s independence from the British Empire. Gandhi agrees\, and mounts a non-violent non-cooperation campaign of unprecedented scale\, coordinating millions of Indians nationwide. There are some setbacks\, such as violence against the protesters and Gandhi''s occasional imprisonment. Nevertheless\, the campaign generates great attention\, and Britain faces intense public pressure. Too weak from World War II to continue enforcing its will in India\, Britain finally grants India''s independence. Indians celebrate this victory\, but their troubles are far from over. Religious tensions between Hindus and Muslims erupt into nation-wide violence. Gandhi declares a hunger strike\, saying he will not eat until the fighting stops. The fighting does stop eventually\, but the country is divided. It is decided that the northwest area of India\, and eastern part of India (current day Bangladesh)\, both places where Muslims are in the majority\, will become a new country called Pakistan (West and East Pakistan respectively). It is hoped that by encouraging the Muslims to live in a separate country\, violence will abate. Gandhi is opposed to the idea\, and is even willing to allow Muhammad Ali Jinnah to become the first prime minister of India\, but the Partition of India is carried out nevertheless. Gandhi spends his last days trying to bring about peace between both nations.
